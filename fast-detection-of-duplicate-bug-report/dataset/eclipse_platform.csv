This will be slow.  ; ; 	Side effects will be that a build runs when the refresh is completed unless you somehow do it in a workspace runnable and dont end the; 	runnable until after the release.  This would be less than optimal as some builders may be responsible for maintaining some invariants and deriving resources which are releasable.  If you dont run the builders before releasing; the invariants will not be maintained and you will release inconsistent state.; ; 	Summary:  Offer to ensure local consistency before releasing.; ; KM (5/31/01 1:30:35 PM); 	See also 1GEAG1A: ITPVCM:WINNT - Internal error comparing with a document; 	which failed with an error.

6,P5,Team,,API - IResource.setLocal has problems (1G5TC8L),"IResource.setLocal has problems.

It is there to support the VCM ; fetching content ; 	and then telling the workspace that it should expect to see the content ; in the file system.; 	Similarly; with scrubLocal.

10,P3,Team,,API - VCM event notification (1G8G6RR),"There seems to be a need for a VCM Event notification model; along the lines; of the activity notification and resource change notification.

We cannot link the team stream creation wizard and the; team stream view at the UI level; because they might well have been created by; different plugins that dont know about each other.; ; Also; repository deletion is not currently supported.

That begs ; the question: Why require a working copy at all when tagging? The only; purpose that it serves is to designate which project and which; revisions of the various files in the project are being tagged. If you could ; specify the project and revisions independently of the working copy; ; no working copy would be necessary.  from CVS manual.; ; CVS can tag (take workspace revisions and tag then in the repo) and ; rtag (no workspace required; take repo revisions and tag. This command; is mostly always used when branching cvs rtag -b -r version1 version1_bugfix ; so you dont tag the team stream but ). Currently we version using ; rtag just because rtag records a tag event in the history and allows ; us to query for existing tags. But using rtag on the team stream (HEAD) is ; dangerous because you dont really know what you are tagging.; ; Notes:; - in our cvs adapter we must use tag where we currently use rtag.; - to find the versions created with tag in the repo the only thing to do (as ; recommended by the CVS docs): ; ; Until then; there are workarounds. You can run cvs log -h and read the ; sections of the output following the header symbolic names:.; ; but how do we chose which file to look into; it could be a file that has just ; been added to the repo?; - we must allow the user to enter his own tag name where ever he can select a ; version.; - we could use rtag internally when branching (creating a new team stream) ; based on a version.; ; BB (26/03/2001 10:31:40 AM); 	I think we should provide two operations: Create a project version from ; a team stream;; 	and create a project version from the workspace. The API has both ; operations:; 	ISharingManager.createProjectVersion(); 	ITeamStream.createProjectVersion(); 	The first one should be on the context menu for projects in the ; navigator; the second one; 	on the context menu for projects in team streams (repository explorer).; 	CVS has both operations too.; ; from Jean-Michels comment: - in our cvs adapter we must use tag where we ; currently use rtag.; 	I disagree.

One action may forget; 	to do the editor close check.  Another may implement a better; special algorithm.  ; ; 	I thoroughly believe the place to do this is the editor.  It contains the domain knowledge; 	required to interpret model specific events appropriately; and provides centralization to reduce; 	code duplication.  The behavior for each editor type will be consistent.  The behavior; 	across editor types may be slightly inconsistent; but there are two points which minimize my; 	concern in this area.  ; ; 	(a) The typical user may invoke hundreds of actions and only ; 	use a handful of editors ( 1 to 5 ?  As a java developer I may only use 1 ).  A slight ; 	inconsistency among 1 to 5 familiar editors is much better than a slight inconsistency ; 	among 100 rarely used actions.  ; ; 	(b) The editor framework gives us a great way to provide the default behavior for free.; ; ; KH (6/8/2001 11:20:15 AM); ;  	The Workbenchs editor framework is thin. As a post June activity it should be improved so that; 	editor implementors do NOT have to handle this case.

1822,P3,UI,,Clicking on task description automatically enters edit mode (1FUMVVL),"This is just a general UI usability comment.  Every time I single-click on a task description with; 	the intent of *selecting* the row; it enters edit mode.  The Description field is by default the largest; 	field in the task list; so its natural that I would likely click there to select the task. ; 	Entering edit mode is kind of a shock every time I do it--I didnt want that!  And it blocks me; 	from using the task menu popup; gives me an edit popup.  I have to click again in another field to ; 	rectify the situation.; ; 	Since single-clicking to select; in my experience; is such a natural thing to do for most people;; 	shouldnt edit mode be activated by a double-click?; ; NOTES:; 	SS (5/8/00 1:04:29 PM); I agree with this usability issue. I think it should be double-click to edit but I know that the cell editors; for tasklist are set up for single click. This is simple enough to change for the beta but likely we will not.; ; DG (5/8/00 4:36:25 PM); Actually; our task list behaves identically to the one in Visual Interdev. They too immediately go; into edit mode when clicked on columns that are editable. Therefore; if our users have a problem; with this; that is because they hated Microsoft behaviour as well; not because we do not follow; style guidelines.; ; I check MS Style Guide and could not find anything specific on going into edit mode in table widgets.; I guess an alternative would be to go into edit mode only if the row was previously selected.; If there are three tasks (a; b and c); and b is currently selected; if I click on description field; of the task c; I will only select c. If b is selected and I click on description field of b;; it will go into edit mode. ; ; To go to this alternative behaviour; we need to:; ; 1) Agree that it is good. It is fairly easy to learn that if you want to select a task without; editing it; you need to click on a non-editable area (for example; task icon in the; first column or file column). Adding more steps to edit may be seen as slow-down; by intermediate and power users.; ; 2) Get the support from JFace. At the moment; cell editor activation is completely; controlled by JFace TableViewer. If we agree that 1) is desirable; we need; to ask for the ability to choose between two cell activation options:; ;      - edit-on-mouse-down in any row;      - edit-on-mouse-down in the selected row; ; Finally; activating on a double-click is not intuitive. The expected action; for double-click is Open and in the context of the task list; the most; logical thing to open is the file associated with the task. This same; behaviour is implemented for bookmarks and breakpoints. ; ; Note: this whole issue is only applicable to tasks. Errors and; warnings that can also appear in the task list are not editable.; ; GDA (5/8/00 5:35:45 PM); 	recommend defer discussion.   Leave as is.; 	Move pr to inactive.; 	; 	[for future here is my comment; 		* double click = bad; 		* click again = ok; 		* click and edit immediately = ok but is annoying at time; ]; ; SS (5/9/00 9:14:56 AM); 	Agree to discuss later.; 	Agree that double click should open file (for tasks).; 	Click again would be good to edit task - this is more like when you rename a file/folder in the; 		File Explorer. ; ; KH (8/2/2001 9:49:16 AM); 	Input for usability discussion only.

In IPerspective.openEditor(IMarker) we query use the marker resource.; Unfortuately; this is not the true target.

The target may or may ; not be an IResource.  ; ; Solution: A target attribute of type URL should be stored on IMarker.  If this target is ; defined by a URL it is possible to target a marker at any object: external jars; repositories; ; file system; etc.  The contents of the URL can be accessed by calling URL.openStream().  ; The URL delegates the implementation of openStream to a URLStreamHandler.  ; One stream handler is registered for each URL scheme (ie; file::; http::; etc).  Core would ; be expected to provide a distinct handler for IResource targets (ie; eclipse::).  Additional ; handlers would be registered for an external jar or repository.; ; In almost all cases a marker will have a target; so perhaps setTarget and getTarget ; should be added to IMarker to guarantee their existence.; ; Problem 2: The appropriate editor for a target is currently determined by target type;  (ie; extension or mime type).  There is no 100% foolproof way to determine the target ; type from a URL or an IMarker.; ; Solution 2: An attribute should be stored on the IMarker to carry the type.  The marker ; creator would be expected to populate this attribute with an appropriate value derived ; from the source data.  This should be feasable.  If the marker creator can traverse ; into a storage area (like a repository or external jar) it can probably determine the type ; of each marker target within.  In IPerspective.openEditor(IMarker) some fallback would ; be taken if target type is absent.  We could popup a dialog asking the user to choose ; an editor.; ; The target type may be the file extension or mime type.  If mime types are adopted in ; core an extension point can be defined for MimeTypeGenerators.  These MimeTypeGenerators ; would be used to determine the mime type of a URL if it is not known.   Other plugins ; could also reuse these generators to determine the type for objects outside the workspace;; like an external jar.

1891,P4,UI,,[PropertiesView] API request: need dynamic property descriptors (1GA9W2Q),There is a need for dynamic property descriptors. Right now; property descriptor is asked to provide a cell editor.; This editor is cached and reused (method getCellEditor is called only once). This is appropriate for static cases.; However; some properties may change nature depending on other properties values. Example:; ; PDE XML Schema editor exposes attribute properties through the property sheet. Attribute type is a set of; choices (string; boolean; etc.). There can also be a restriction on a base type (for example; base type string; can be restricted with a list of choices - an enumeration). Depending on values of properties type and ; restriction; property value needs to use different cell editors. For a boolean type; default value; can only be true or false. For a string type; it should be a text cell editor. However; if there; is an enumeration restriction on the string type; value cell editor should be a combo box containing only; the list of choices defined on the restriction.; ; Right now; I am using text cell editor and trying to catch restriction violation using cell validator.; However; this is against the good UI design practice to dissalow users to enter invalid input in the; first place; rather than punish them later.; ; This would be easy to implement if getCellEditor on the property descriptor would be called each time.; The implementation of the desciptor can choose to cache the editor; or create a new widget every time.; The key is to provide an API on IPropertyDescriptor interface to indicate that cell editor should; not be cached by the property sheet entry (IPropertyDescriptor.setDynamic(boolean)/isDynamic() seem; like a sensible choice).
